Artificial Intelligence

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, an ideal "intelligent" machine
is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at an
arbitrary goal." (The intelligent agent paradigm:Russell & Norvig 2003, pp. 27, 32–58, 968–972; Poole, Mackworth & Goebel
1998, pp. 7–21; Luger & Stubblefield 2004, pp. 235–240; Hutter 2005, pp. 125–126)
