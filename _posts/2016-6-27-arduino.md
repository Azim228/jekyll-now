Short information about Arduino:

"Arduino is a hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures computer open-source hardware, open-source software, and microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices."

Today I started working with arduino uno. My partner was Lyailya and we together completed different schemes in arduino starter kit. There are 12 different schemes that we should accomplish. I have accomplished 11 of them.
I couldn't finish 11th one because there was a problem with some sensors or something like that, so we couldn't fix this problem but other 11 worked properly and I think that working with arduino is fun. I memorised all my knowledge from start of 9th grade about circuits, resistors, potentiometers, LDR, TDR and others.
I really enjoyed working with Lyailya and arduino because we together come over the obstacles and tried to find a solution. Working with arduino is very perspective because it is shows how to work with hardware and mix it with software. Such that I have known more about hardware part of the computer. In future and especially in robotics it is very useful knowledge because it helps me to modify the robot and work with custom programs, not only Lego Mindstorms. Also I have inquired that arduino is compatible with Lego and it will help on robotcs contest in september.
